# Titanic Dataset EDA using Power BI

This Power BI project performs **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- File used: `train.csv`

## Features Used
- Survived (target variable)
- Pclass (Passenger Class)
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
- Fare
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

## Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed irrelevant columns (`PassengerId`, `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`)
- Filled missing `Age` values with median age (~28 years)
- Filled missing `Embarked` values with mode (`S` - Southampton)
- Converted categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) for analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights
- Visualized survival counts overall and by gender & passenger class
- Created an Age distribution histogram using bin groups
- Analyzed survival trends based on embarkation ports

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation
